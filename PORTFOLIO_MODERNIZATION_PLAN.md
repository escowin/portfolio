# Portfolio Modernization Development Plan

## üéØ Project Overview

This document outlines the comprehensive modernization plan for my developer portfolio. The current portfolio showcases older projects and uses outdated technology (React 18.2.0, react-scripts 5.0.1). The goal is to modernize the tech stack, highlight recent advanced projects, and improve the visual communication of technology stacks.

## üìä Current State Analysis

### Technology Stack (Outdated)
- **React**: 18.2.0 (current: 19.x)
- **Build Tool**: react-scripts 5.0.1 (outdated, should use Vite)
- **Package Manager**: npm (acceptable)
- **Deployment**: GitHub Pages (acceptable)
- **Styling**: Vanilla CSS (acceptable but could be modernized)

### Current Project Structure
- **Frontend Projects**: 8 projects (mix of old and new)
- **Backend Projects**: 8 projects (mostly older)
- **Fullstack Projects**: 6 projects (mix of old and new)
- **Highlighted Projects**: Only 3 projects currently highlighted

### Issues Identified
1. **Outdated Dependencies**: React 18.2.0 vs current 19.x
2. **Build Tool**: react-scripts is deprecated, should use Vite
3. **Project Prioritization**: Advanced recent projects not highlighted
4. **Tech Stack Communication**: Poor visual representation of technologies
5. **Project Categories**: Need better organization for recent work
